To help affected families, the DC Housing Authority voted to set aside 1,300 federal vouchers in July, and the DC Council voted to fund about 600 additional vouchers in its 2025 budget. However, according to Laura Zeilinger from DC's Department of Human Services, there was actually no money to pay for the Council's 600 vouchers.

## Type 2 - Multi-Source Integration Questions:

**Q11: How has DC's approach to public housing funding and maintenance changed since 2018, and what are the current repair needs?**

**A**: Between FY2018-2021, DC committed $97 million total for public housing repairs ($19 million in FY2018, $3.25 million in FY2019, $24.5 million in FY2020, and $50 million in FY2021). However, DCHA reports needing $405 million for immediate repairs over the next six years and $2.5 billion for long-term repairs - showing a significant funding gap.

**Q12: How have historical housing policies affected current racial disparities in DC housing, particularly in the Southeast?**

**A**: The impact can be traced from 1935 HOLC "redlining" maps through to present day statistics. Areas marked as "hazardous" or "declining" were predominantly inhabited by people of color, especially in Southeast DC. This historical discrimination is reflected in current statistics showing Black homeownership rates declining in historically Black neighborhoods - while Black residents make up 87% of homeowners East of the Anacostia River, they represent a dramatically decreasing percentage of new home buyers in recent years.

**Q13: What are the main challenges facing DC's Housing Production Trust Fund and Inclusionary Zoning program?**

**A**: The Trust Fund, despite spending over $100 million, only directed 19% of funds to the city's poorest residents despite a legal requirement of 50%. The Inclusionary Zoning program has only met 4.3% of community needs, creating 360 units compared to a demand of 11,624 units. Both programs have fallen short of their intended impact due to poor prioritization and implementation challenges.

**Q14: How has the Housing Production Trust Fund's effectiveness changed over time, and what are the main challenges it faces in 2024?**

**A**: The Housing Production Trust Fund has faced persistent challenges in meeting its goals. While it receives substantial funding (over $100 million), its effectiveness has been limited by poor targeting and implementation. The law requires 50% of funds to be directed to the lowest-income residents, but as of 2022, only 19% reached this group. The Fund has also struggled to create enough affordable units - it primarily relies on the DC Local Rent Supplement Program (LRSP) to provide subsidies, which covered about 80% of Trust Funded units. However, in 2024, the Trust Fund announced it would no longer fund new construction, instead focusing exclusively on shoring up existing projects at risk of foreclosure due to rent payment issues.

## Type 3 - Analysis and Strategy Questions:

**Q15: What would be the most effective strategy to address DC's affordable housing crisis based on the evidence presented in these documents?**

**A**: The most effective strategy would likely be a three-pronged approach:

1. Increase funding and improve management of existing public housing maintenance to address the $2.5 billion repair backlog and improve the current 74% occupancy rate
2. Reform the Housing Production Trust Fund to ensure it meets its 50% requirement for lowest-income residents while improving implementation and oversight
3. Expand and strengthen the Inclusionary Zoning program with better enforcement mechanisms, given it has only met 4.3% of community needs

This approach addresses both preservation of existing affordable housing and creation of new units, while ensuring better targeting of resources to those most in need.

- "Affordable Housing Policies in the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area" (2023)

**Q16: How could DC better address racial disparities in housing access and ownership, considering both historical policies and current challenges?**

**A**: Based on the evidence, DC should implement a comprehensive strategy that includes:

1. Reform lending practices to address continuing impacts of historical redlining, particularly in Southeast DC where Black homeownership rates are declining despite historically being a predominantly Black area
2. Strengthen anti-displacement protections in gentrifying neighborhoods, especially given that while Black residents make up 87% of homeowners East of the Anacostia River, they represent a dramatically decreasing percentage of new home buyers
3. Ensure equitable distribution of affordable housing development across all wards, addressing the current concentration of affordable units in certain areas
4. Improve Housing Production Trust Fund implementation to better serve lowest-income residents, who are disproportionately people of color

- "Affordable Housing Policies in the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area" (2023)

**Q17: How can DC effectively balance immediate housing needs with long-term affordable housing sustainability?**

**A**: Based on the evidence, DC should:

1. Address immediate crisis:

- Direct resources to prevent foreclosures of existing affordable properties
- Improve maintenance of current public housing stock ($405 million needed for immediate repairs)
- Better utilize existing units (address the 74% occupancy rate in public housing)

2. Build long-term sustainability:

- Reform program implementation to ensure Housing Production Trust Fund meets its legal requirements
- Improve geographic distribution of affordable housing across all planning areas
- Create stronger preservation incentives for existing affordable units
- Develop more effective public-private partnerships for new development

3. Improve system efficiency:

- Streamline administrative processes
- Strengthen program oversight
- Better coordinate between various housing programs and agencies
